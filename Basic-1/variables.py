# Variables are used to store data values.
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
# Python has no command for declaring a variable.

name = "Muhammad"; # A string variable
age = 25; # An integer variable
height = 5.8; # A float variable

print(name);
print(age);
print(height);
print(name, age, height);

print(name, age, height, sep=' - ');
